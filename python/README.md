## Learning Python 
Python can be used and runned through multiple ways, but the main way a beginner will use python is through a [jupyter notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) and its Google implementation [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). 

The nicest thing about google colab is that you don't have to install anything on your own computer. All you need to do is go to https://colab.research.google.com/ webpage where google provides you access a full linux server with python 3 and a few common python packages already installed. 

You can as an example run the notebooks present within this repostiory (and any repositories available on GitHub via google colab).

The following notebooks present the different python ways to retrieve Hakai's data and generate a plot:

1. [Get Hakai QU39 Data through the Hakai API](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HakaiInstitute/hakai-oceanography-data-demo/blob/main/python/get_hakai_api_data_demo.ipynb)
2. [Get Hakai QU39 Data through ERDDAP ](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HakaiInstitute/hakai-oceanography-data-demo/blob/main/python/get_hakai_erddap_data_demo.ipynb)

### Run python locally

Multiple ways exists to run python locally among these, the most popular are:
- **Jupyter Noteboook** (recommended): I would recommend this if you want to do a quick analysys, data visualization or exploration. Learn more here https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/
- **Jupyter Lab**: Same as the notebook but with a more extensive interface to open multiple notebooks. Learn more here: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html
- **VSCode** (recommended): This is becoming the most popular tool for developping any bigger programming projects. Not just in python but in pretty much any languages. VSCode also can handle jupyter notebooks. VSCode is owned by Microsoft (like GitHub) and is freely available. This page present how to get started with VSCode in Python: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

### Where I can learn more?
A lot of ressources exist online to get started with Python among those:
- VSCode made by Microsoft is one of the most popular IDE to use with python, here's their tutorial on [how to use python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
- Microsoft made a number of videos available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/intro-to-python-development/?wt.mc_id=python-c9-niner)
- RealPython is a good ressource to learn some of the basics
    - [MatLab vs Python](https://realpython.com/matlab-vs-python/)
    
- Google is always handy ;)
